<h2><b><u>OneTakeStudios</u></b></h2>

<p>OneTakeStudios is a game development "studio" that are working on all kinds of games - from horror to sandbox games; we've got it all!</p>
<p>Our current main focus is an SCP game, where you are a Site Director and you're tasked with constructing a suitable SCP Facility to</p>
<p>contain numerous deadly anomolies.</p>

<h3><b><u>Who are you?</u></b></h3>

<p>OneTakeStudios is a relatively new game development "studio", we have been around for two years now but only recently have we been ramping</p>
<p>up our game and commencing development on games - so far we do <b>not</b> have any released games but we're planning to announce the launch</p>
<p>dates for SCP: Site Director soon, most likely in the next few weeks. Currently, we will only be releasing our games on our website and itch</p>
<p>but we are considering expanding in the future. You can find our itch.io page here: https://onetake-studioz.itch.io/</p>
